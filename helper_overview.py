st.markdown("""As a reminder, the overall flow is as follows: 
1. The user will get asked questions you pre-specify. 
2. The system extracts their answers and creates three different 'tones' of narrative (using 'personas'), which all rely on the same information & user words. 
3. Finally the user will pick & adapt one of these stories to really make it their own. 
\n \n A good mental model is to think about the answers as the _'key information'_ that makes the story, whereas what is supplied by the personas is just the _'connective tissue'_ ... something that is important for the narrative to make sense, but adds ideally not extra information. """)

st.markdown("""### Implementation and the importance of good template

The key piece of information coming from the researcher is the :violet[template] (see image below). 

You don't need to change anything about the system otherwise, thanks to the :magic_wand: of modular, agent-based LLMs.

st.markdown("""Specifically, the :violet[template] determines three things: 
1. **the core questions** you want the system to ask ... and the answers to which will combine into a *good* story! This is the heart of a good micro-narrative, and the ability for the researcher to 'inject' some psychological theory into the story creation.
2. **example answers set & scenario**, which teaches the LLM how to combine your questions into a linear narrative 
3. **three personas**, which guides how the system fills in the 'connective tissue' in between the user's answers. 

Note that the :violet[core questions] are going to be different to what you would normally use in interviews -- the idea here is that you use each question to uncover another key facet of the story you think the participant can tell; while ensuring that putting these all facets together creates a coherent story. 

In our experience, the best micro-narratives happen when the questions ask about parts of participants' experience that they might not consider necessarily important, but that pull out something crucial about their perspective about the world. 

As a team, we are still trying to understand how best to generate such templates, and how to help others to do so too ... thus also this :robot_face::factory:.

st.markdown("""### What now? 

The rest of this system is created to help you make all three steps of the template, one at a time. 

1. First, we will look at identifying the *questions* you think the bot should be asking 
   ‚û° **üí° Design your question** 

2. Second, you can try out how these questions would work in the bot (and collect a sample dialogue in the process)  ‚û° **üß™ Test data collection**

3. Third, you can use this sample dialogue to see how the narratives shape up based on your questions (or not). This then also creates your *answer set*, which is the key example of how to combine answers to narratives in your bot  ‚û° **‚öôÔ∏è Build your bot**

_Please do expect that the steps 1-3  *could be an iterative process, as getting the questions right is what makes or breaks your micro-narrative bot*!_

4. After you are happy with your questions and answer set, you can move onto to test your three *personas* you would like your system to use ‚û° **üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Finetune your personas**

5. Finally, the system will write out the three main parts of the configuration you've created (i.e., your questions, example answer set, personas) so you can copy & paste these into your config file ‚û° **üöÄ Export your config**
