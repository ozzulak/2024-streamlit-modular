# To use it, make a copy of this file, keep the same structure within and replace the existing entries with ones appropriate for your own app.

# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/
#
# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

Question: Tell me about something bad or stressful that happened to you today?
Answer: I invited a friend to lunch and they said no

Answer: I've been feeling quite alone lately, I just wanted to hang out with someone. I reached out to them but they said they were busy
Question: How did you react with your behavior?
Answer: I texted back that it was ok, but it made me really down the rest of the day. I just stayed at home in my room
Question: What were your thoughts at the time about it?
Answer: It made me think maybe they were not busy, that they actually didn't want to see me. That maybe I'm a loser that doesn't have many friends
Question: How did the situation make you feel and how intense was the feeling?

scenario = """
Today was a tough day for me. I've been feeling quite alone lately and really wanted to spend some time with a friend. So, I decided to invite a friend to lunch, hoping it would cheer me up. Unfortunately, they said they were busy and couldn't make it. I texted back saying it was okay, but deep down, it made me feel really low. I started thinking that maybe they weren't really busy and just didn't want to see me, thinking that deep down Iâ€™m a loser and no one really care about me. This way of thinking about the situation made me feel even worse, I felt lonely and sad. I ended up staying in my room for the rest of the day, not feeling motivated to do anything. Itâ€™s like it ruined my whole day. The feeling was so intense, it felt like a heavy, tight, black cloud over my chest and throat. It was hard to shake off, and I couldn't help but wonder if I might be feeling depressed
