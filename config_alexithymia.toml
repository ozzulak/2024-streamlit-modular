# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

Question: Tell me about something bad or stressful that happened to you today?
Answer: I invited a friend to lunch and they said no
Question: What’s the context? What else should we know about the situation?
Answer: I've been feeling quite alone lately, I just wanted to hang out with someone. I reached out to them but they said they were busy
Question: How did you react with your behavior?
Answer: I texted back that it was ok, but it made me really down the rest of the day. I just stayed at home in my room
Question: What were your thoughts at the time about it?
Answer: It made me think maybe they were not busy, that they actually didn't want to see me. That maybe I'm a loser that doesn't have many friends
Question: How did the situation make you feel and how intense was the feeling?
Answer: I felt lonely, sad, I think I might be depressed
Question: With this feeling, let’s think about it like a curious scientist – explore it –Where did you feel it in your body? What shape is it? What colour is it? Is it heavy or light? Is it moving or still?
Answer: I felt it over my chest and throat, a heaviness, a tightness. It's like a really black colour.

scenario = """
Today was a tough day for me. I've been feeling quite alone lately and really wanted to spend some time with a friend. So, I decided to invite a friend to lunch, hoping it would cheer me up. Unfortunately, they said they were busy and couldn't make it. I texted back saying it was okay, but deep down, it made me feel really low. I started thinking that maybe they weren't really busy and just didn't want to see me, thinking that deep down I’m a loser and no one really care about me. This way of thinking about the situation made me feel even worse, I felt lonely and sad. I ended up staying in my room for the rest of the day, not feeling motivated to do anything. It’s like it ruined my whole day. The feeling was so intense, it felt like a heavy, tight, black cloud over my chest and throat. It was hard to shake off, and I couldn't help but wonder if I might be feeling depressed
