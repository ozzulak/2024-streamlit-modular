# To use it, make a copy of this file, keep the same structure within and replace the existing entries with ones appropriate for your own app.

# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/
#
# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

Question: What was the win or breakthrough situation you experienced?
Answer: "Visiting the supermarket with my child has always been difficult. Last week though, we had a fantastic trip! Got all the shopping, ticked everything off my list, and finished really quickly without my child getting upset."
Question: I’d like to know more about the situation. What was happening at the time that was making the situation tricky?
Answer: "They've been getting really upset as we walk around the supermarket. They always want to stop for sweets, and get upset when I say no."
Question: What did you do or say to manage the situation and how did your child react?
Answer: "Normally I try and finish the shopping quickly, but my child gets more and more upset. Last week we had a snack before we left. My child was a bit puzzled by why we were eating so early, but they were okay with it."
Question:  How did that make you feel?
Answer: "Hopeful - and it worked! No requests for snacks in the supermarket."
Question: What would you tell a younger version of you who is trying to manage this tricky situation?

scenario = """
Going to the supermarket with my child used to be a real challenge. \
Every time we went, my child would get upset because they wanted sweets, and I would have to say no. \
It made shopping stressful and difficult. \
But last week, something amazing happened. \
Before we left for the supermarket, we had a snack together. \
My child was a bit confused about eating so early, but they were okay with it. \
This small change made a big difference. \
We managed to get all our shopping done quickly, and my child didn't ask for snacks or get upset at all. \
It felt really hopeful and positive. \
If I could give advice to my younger self, it would be to always have a snack before heading to the shops. \
It really worked for us!
