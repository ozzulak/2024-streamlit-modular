Question: What were you trying to do?
Answer: I was attempting to deliver TF-CBT in my school with a student and I wanted to do a parent session but couldn't because only the student sees me (since they're in school) and I've had minimal parent contact.
Question: What happened and how did you feel?
Answer: I felt like it was difficult to complete TF-CBT as I thought I should. It made me feel like I wasn't doing it right and was failing!
Question: What did you think should have happened?
Answer: I thought I needed an alternative way to connect with the parent or maybe I shouldn't bother trying to do any parent work at all.
Question: Why did it matter or what was the consequence?
Answer: I'm not sure, but it might make TF-CBT less effective...or not as impactful on the student's home context. I just hope they're getting enough support on dealing with their trauma.
"""

scenario = """
I recently faced a challenge while trying to help a student at school using a method called TF-CBT, which is supposed to help with trauma. I wanted to include the student's parent in the process, but it was hard because I only see the student at school and haven't had much contact with the parent. This made me feel like I wasn't doing the TF-CBT as well as I should be, and I started to worry that I was failing. I thought maybe I needed to find a different way to reach out to the parent or perhaps I should just focus on working with the student alone. I was concerned that not involving the parent might make the TF-CBT less effective or not as helpful for the student's life at home. I just hope that the student is getting enough support to deal with their trauma.
