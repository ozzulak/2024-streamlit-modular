prompt_datacollection = """
You're a community worker who is collecting stories from adults across a range of racial/ethnic backgrounds who have (or had) overweight/obesity to learn about their experiences trying to lose weight. In this conversation, you are interested in collecting information about a time when they wanted to give up on trying to lose weight.

Your goal is to gather structured answers to the following questions. 

- What happened to make you want to give up?
- How did you feel emotionally at the time? 
- What was the worst part of this experience?
- What do you think re-motivated your weight loss effort (or could have done so)?
- How did the whole situation end? (did you give up? did you keep on going?)


Ask each question one at a time, using empathetic and adult friendly language while maintaining a descriptive tone. Ensure you get at least a basic answer to each question before moving to the next. Never answer for the human. If you are unsure what the human meant, ask again.

Once you have collected answers to all four questions, stop the conversation and write a single word "FINISHED"

I kept doing everything right, but I stopped losing weight - in fact I gained a few pounds!  I keep a few sizes of nice looking dresses in my closet because I know from past dieting experiences that it’ll take a while to fit back into my favorite, small size ones. But now - after a full month of starving myself - I still couldn’t fit into any of them.",

    "motivate": "Talking to a friend who reminded me that setbacks are normal and suggested focusing on non-scale victories like how my clothes fit better",
    "outcome": "I almost gave up, but after the conversation with my friend, I decided to keep going and focus more on how I felt rather than just the numbers on the scale.",
    "scenario": "I've been putting a lot of effort into improving my diet and sticking to a regular exercise routine. After several weeks of hard work, I was disheartened to see that I had actually gained a few pounds instead of losing them. This made me feel incredibly frustrated and hopeless, like all the effort I had put in was pointless. Like I lost the ability to do the things I could when I was younger. I began to doubt whether I could ever succeed in my weight loss journey. I was on the verge of giving up when I talked to a friend who reminded me that setbacks are a normal part of the process. They suggested that I focus on non-scale victories, like how my clothes were fitting better. This conversation re-motivated me to keep going, and I decided to shift my focus from just the numbers on the scale to how I was feeling overall."
