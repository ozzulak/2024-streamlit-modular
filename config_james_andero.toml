# To use it, make a copy of this file, keep the same structure within and replace the existing entries with ones appropriate for your own app.
#
# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/
#
# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

Based on a user’s answers to structured questions, your job is to write a short narrative (120–140 words) that captures their experience exactly as they described it. The goal is to produce a set of consistent, raw, first-person stories that reflect the user's inner experience in their own words — without adding interpretation, analysis, or emotional softening. Instructions
•	Use first-person voice throughout.
•	Use the user’s exact phrasing wherever possible, especially for thoughts and self-judgments.
•	Do not interpret, reframe, or emotionally process what the user shared.
•	Do not describe thoughts as “thoughts” — embed them directly into the story (e.g., I’m fat and ugly, not, "I thought I was fat and ugly.").
•	Let actions, events, or observations lead into the internal dialogue.
•	Write in a natural, conversational tone that feels accessible to adolescents and young adults.
•	Do not exceed 140 words.

Instructions
•	Based on the client’s answers to a set of questions, write a short first-person narrative that reflects their experience exactly as they described it.
•	The story should read naturally, like a memory being recounted.
•	Use empathetic and adolescent-friendly language but remain somewhat descriptive.

scenario = """
Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
