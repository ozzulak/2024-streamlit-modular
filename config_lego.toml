# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/
#
# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

We want to hear about a time you felt really close to your mates onlineâ€”even though you werenâ€™t in the same room.

**What we're looking for:**  
Maybe you were hanging out on Roblox, playing Fortnite, sharing clips that made you laugh , just chatting, or doing whatever else you get up to.
We want to chat about a time when it felt like you were having the best time together ðŸŽ‰â€”even though you werenâ€™t in the same room.

**How this works:**  
On the following screens, a chatbot ðŸ¤– will ask you a few quick things like:
â€¢ What you and your mates were doing
â€¢ How it made you feel
â€¢ What made it cool
â€¢ Why it felt like proper fun

There's no right or wrong answerâ€”we just want to hear your story! ðŸ˜€
  
**Why weâ€™re asking:**

We want to know what makes time with mates brilliant, even when youâ€™re not in the same roomâ€”so we can help make games and online hangs feel just as good as being there in person.

**Ready? Let's go!** ðŸš€

Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
