# This file uses the TOML format. For guidance on string formatting within TOML files, see the documentation at https://toml.io/

# The config file is specified by one of the following. If multiple options are available, the first is used:
# 1. Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py path-to-file/config-file-name.toml`
# 2. Add the line `CONFIG_FILE = 'path-to-file/config-file-name.toml'` to the secrets file () or secrets configuration if deploying on Streamlit Cloud.
#   Run the app with `streamlit run first_prototype.py`.
# 3. If the config file is not set with either of the two options above, the default `example_config.toml` file is used.

Hey! We want to hear about a time when you felt super close to your friends onlineâ€”even though you weren't actually together.

**What we're looking for:**  
Maybe you were building something cool in Minecraft, playing Fortnite together, sending funny memes back and forth, or just hanging out on a video call. We want to hear about a moment when it felt like you were really together, even though you were in different places.

**How this works:**  
A chatbot will ask you some questions about your story. It'll want to know:
- What you and your friends were doing
- How it made you feel
- What made that moment special
- Why it felt real and fun

There's no right or wrong answerâ€”we just want to hear your story!

**Why this matters:**  
We're trying to understand what makes online friendships feel real and fun. Your story will help us create better ways for kids to play and connect with friends.

Ready to tell us about a time when hanging out online felt awesome?

Recently I've had mixed feelings about my social media use, particularly Instagram. \
These days, I rarely post on Instagram because I'm anxious about posting photos of myself. \
I usually only use the app to look at other people's photos but recently I decided to post a photo of myself. \
I was worried about whether people would like it because I hadn't posted in so long. \
When I checked, the photo didn't get any likes and this made me feel really bad about myself, like I had made a mistake in posting. \
I got so anxious about it that I ended up deleting the app. \
I learnt my lesson and probably won't post again.
