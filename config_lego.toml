We want to hear about a time you felt really close to your mates onlineâ€”even though you werenâ€™t in the same room.

**What we're looking for:**  
Maybe you were hanging out on Roblox, playing Fortnite, sharing clips that made you laugh , just chatting, or doing whatever else you get up to.
We want to chat about a time when it felt like you were having the best time together ðŸŽ‰â€”even though you werenâ€™t in the same room.

**How this works:**  
On the following screens, a chatbot :robot: will ask you a few quick things like:
- What you and your mates were doing
- How it made you feel
- What made it cool
- Why it felt like proper fun

There's no right or wrong answerâ€”we just want to hear your story! ðŸ˜€
  
**Why weâ€™re asking:**

We want to know what makes time with mates brilliant, even when youâ€™re not in the same roomâ€”so we can help make games and online hangs feel just as good as being there in person.

**Ready? Let's go!** ðŸš€

So, last night was epic! We were all online, diving into Fortnite, and it was one of those nights where everything just clicked. We were in the zone, like seriously, every move was perfect. In-game chat was lit with all of us hyping each other up. We snagged a victory royale, and it felt like we were unstoppable, just mowing down everyone in sight. It was one of those rare times where the squad was totally in sync, and it felt like we were the coolest team ever. I swear, we were on fire, and it was a night to remember.
