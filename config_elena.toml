In this task youâ€™re going to engage with a prototype chatbot. It will ask you imagine how you, as a researcher, could benefit from datasets data donations that young provide. 

*How could this look like?* 
The data donation platform will hold data from hundreds of youth, who will have provided time-series data on their social media use, the websites they visit, as well as potentially self-report of their mood and wellbeing.

In what follows, we will want to create a simple story: if this were available, how could you use it? What is the most powerful study you can imagine you would love to run if you had this data; but cannot run without it?
