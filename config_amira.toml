Recently, I had an experience with social media that left me feeling powerless. \
I realized that using these apps was really affecting my self-esteem in a negative way. \
To cope with these feelings, I decided to delete the app altogether. \

If a friend went through something similar, I would recommend they also consider stepping away from social media, as it can be harmful to one's well-being.
